# LagrangianRegression
This contains regression analysis programs for the Lagrangian function applied to the data of the company Infosys. 
The programs are coded in Python using the data libraries numpy and pandas. 
In this repository are linear regression analysis programs to model functions of budget and revenue with variables year and number of employees for each function.
There are also multiple regression analysis programs to model multivariable functions of budget and revenue which were then used in the application of the Lagrangian.
